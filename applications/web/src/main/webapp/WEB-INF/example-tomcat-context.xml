  Example context file for Tomcat 6.

  Copy to ${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/Catalina/localhost/<name-of-war>.xml

  Modify the username/password and url to reflect whatever database should be used.

  Note: We want the default database engine used to be InnoDB, which is what the
  sessionVariable setting in the url should do.

  This is only necessary for pre Mysql-5.5.5 though, as from 5.5.5 onwards InnoDb is
  the default database engine.

    <!-- maxActive: Maximum number of database connections in pool. Make sure you
         configure your mysqld max_connections large enough to handle
         all of your db connections. Set to -1 for no limit.
         -->

    <!-- maxIdle: Maximum number of idle database connections to retain in pool.
         Set to -1 for no limit.  See also the DBCP documentation on this
         and the minEvictableIdleTimeMillis configuration parameter.

    <!-- maxWait: Maximum time to wait for a database connection to become available
         in ms, in this example 10 seconds. An Exception is thrown if
         this timeout is exceeded.  Set to -1 to wait indefinitely.
